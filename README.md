Bindings Spider
======

Dynamically map open windows to function keys for easy access. Can be called both for setting and calling saved windows.

Designed to be invoked via environmental keybinds, check -h for syntax.
Personally used to set current window with Alt+F2 and later invoke it with F2 and so on.

Core functionality works, except when window names change. (to be changed)
